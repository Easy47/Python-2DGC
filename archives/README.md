# Usage
These notebooks are my work notebooks (draft). They can be useful to find additional usage examples. To be able to **run these notebooks** you have to **copy and paste** the notebook you want to execute in the **src folder or add and execute this block of code at the beginning of the notebook** to set sys path to src folder.


```python
import os, sys
path_to_scr_folder=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath('')), 'src')
#set sys path to src folder
sys.path.append(path_to_scr_folder)
```
